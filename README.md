# dct-dwt-comparator

## Overview

- read an RGB file and convert the file to an 8x8 block based DCT representation (as used in the JPEG implementation) and a DWT representation (as used in the JPEG2000 implementation)
- compare and contrast between DCT and DWT using different coefficients and display them side to side to progressly compare the results with various coefficients
- implemented in Rust and GUI with GTK for efficency and safety
